# TryHackMe Pre-Security Path

## Overview
This repo documents my progress through TryHackMe's **Pre-Security Path**, covering fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as networking, encryption, and threat intelligence.
This serves as a reference for key learnings and practical exercises I've encountered.

## Topics Covered
### 1️⃣ Introduction to Cyber Security
- **Offensive Security Imtro** - Understanding how attackers think and exploit vulnerabilities.
  - Exploring common attack vectors such as phising and social engineering.
  - Understading the improtance of penetration testing in security assessments.
 
- **Defensive Security Intro** - Implementing security controls to mitigae attacks.
  - Configuring basic firewall rules useing 'ufw' on linux:



Networking Fundamentals
- **OSI & TCP/IP Models:** Understanding data flow.
- **Common Protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS.
- **Networking Tools:**
  - 'ping', 'traceroute', 'netstat', 'ipconfig'. 'ifconfig'
  - **Example:** Running a traceroute:
    '''sh traceroute google.com'''
  - **Wireshark Analysis:** Captured packets of different protocols
