# 🐍 Python for Cybersecurity – My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repo where I document everything I'm learning about Python from scratch. I'm starting with [NetworkChuck's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) and
then working through Python-related rooms and paths on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

print("Enter text to print to screen")
input() *designed to take input from the user and converts to string.

print("Hello, welcome to the cafe!")

name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello " + name + ", Thank you so much for coming in today.")

menu = "Black Coffee, Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, Frappuccino"

menu = input("Here is what we are serving today: " + menu + "\nWhat would you like?\n")

print("Great, " + menu + " Coming right up!")

order = input("Can I get your order number for " + name + "?\n")

print("Sounds good " + name + "! We'll have that " + menu + " ready for you in a moment!!")

## 📘 Notes by Topic

---

### 🧠 Task 1 – Introduction to Python  
This was my first look into Python—just understanding what it is and what it's used for. I liked that it's used a lot in cybersecurity and automation, which is why I’m learning it.

---

### 👋 Task 2 – Hello World  
My first Python program! Just printed `Hello, World!` to the screen. Super simple but felt cool to make something actually run in the terminal.

---

### ➕ Task 3 – Mathematical Operators  
I learned how Python can do basic math like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and even how to square a number with `**`. This is when I saw Python was more than just printing stuff—it can really think.

---

### 📦 Task 4 – Variables and Data Types  
This clicked for me. Variables are like storage boxes. I learned the difference between strings, integers, floats, booleans, and lists—and how to store them and use them in my code.

---

### 🔁 Task 5 – Logical and Boolean Operators  
This introduced things like `and`, `or`, and `not`. It took a second to wrap my head around, but I started to see how they’re used in decisions and conditions inside a program.

---

### 📦 Task 6 – Shipping Project / If Statements  
This was my first time writing a real mini project. I used `if` statements to decide when to add shipping costs. It showed me how you can make Python act differently depending on the data.

---

### 🔄 Task 7 – Loops  
Loops were tricky at first but powerful. I learned how to use `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks without writing the same lines over and over.

---

### ₿ Task 8 – Bitcoin Project / Functions  
This was a big step. I learned how to group code into reusable blocks called functions. It made my code cleaner and helped me understand how real programs are structured.

---

### 🗂️ Task 9 – Files  
I learned how to open and read/write files. Now I can make Python save info, read logs, or even automate basic text editing. This felt like a big step toward building tools.

---

### 📥 Task 10 – Imports  
This showed me how to bring in outside tools (modules) into my code. I used things like `random`, `math`, and `time`—now I understand Python has a whole toolbox ready to use.

---

### 📝 Final Thoughts (So Far)  
Each step has built on the last. I went from printing text to building projects, reading files, and writing functions. I’m still learning, but I’m starting to see how this all connects—and how I’ll be able to build tools for cybersecurity in the future.

## 🧾 Personal Reflection

> I’m starting with zero Python experience, but I’m committed to learning it for cybersecurity. My goal is to be able to build my own tools, automate tasks, and become a more effective defender. This repo will be my trail of progress.
